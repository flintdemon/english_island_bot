This bot was written for an English language school. The bot offers to take a language test, gives your level and offers to send contacts to the school to sign up for a trial lesson.

The list of questions for the test is kept in a simple yaml file. The telegram token and chat id where the user's contact will be sent is defined in environment variables. The bot is packaged in docker using Gitlab CI / CD.
